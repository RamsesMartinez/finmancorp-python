### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment-with-docker.html) for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8025`
